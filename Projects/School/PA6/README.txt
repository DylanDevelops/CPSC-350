SOURCES
Below are all the sources I used throughout my project. Next to each link is how it helped me specifically with the project.
    - For my WGraph, I used the completed code that Dr. Eel provided us
    - My file processor was modified from projects I have used a file processor before
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-in-cpp/ (This helped me understand the const keyword, which I used to define edges of the graph)
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10575766/comparison-operator-overloading (Helped me understand operator overloading)
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35558028/c-structure-issue (More help with operating overloading)
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graphs-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/ (Assistance with understanding graphs as a whole)
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/const-keyword-in-cpp/ (Helped me understand why const was important)
    - https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Passing-By-Reference-To-Const-in-C/ (Helped me understand why the heck you would pass by reference and use const)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZBQLXgSGfs (Helped me understand union sets and finds for Kruskalâ€™s algorithm)
