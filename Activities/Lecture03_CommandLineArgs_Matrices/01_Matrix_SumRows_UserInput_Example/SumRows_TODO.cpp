/*
    You need to create a C++ program with three main parts. First, write a sumRows() 
    function that takes a matrix of integers (as a pointer to an array of pointers)
     and a one-dimensional array (as a pointer). This function will calculate the sum of each row 
     in the matrix and store these sums in the one-dimensional array. 
     
     Next, create a randomMatrix() function that accepts the number of rows and columns as input, 
     then fills a dynamically allocated matrix with random integers. 
     
     Finally, in the main() function, prompt the user to input the dimensions of the matrix, 
     allocate memory for it, and use randomMatrix() to fill it with random values. After displaying the matrix, 
     call sumRows() to compute and display the sum of each row. 
     Remember tofree the allocated memory before the program exits to avoid memory leaks.

// Function to fill an array with the sum of each row of the matrix



// Function to create a matrix with random integers



int main() {
    
    
    return 0;
